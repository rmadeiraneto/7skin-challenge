# 7skin-challenge
 
Notes:

- in a real project I would:
- add react routing, wrap nav menu items in an anchor and setting its isActive prop to a condition based on the page that were being rendered
- ARIA attributes
- add documentation
- add lazy loading or pagination to the table
- add a more mobile friendly way of showing data in chart
- have designers providing nice mockups :D

Project created with Create React App, just run 'start' npm script in order to run it locally

Here's a preview of the exercise
